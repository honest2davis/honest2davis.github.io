<p>I’ve been building my experience in the music industry for a number of years and I help artists and creators by selling them my instrumentals. Why? Because the market is getting bigger. In 2015, the IFPI measured the music market to be valued at $15 billion USD.

Technology has allowed music to become more accessible to a larger group that have niche tastes. This changes the approach with how we can monetise our music journeys. The old way was to buy some studio time, record and then spend money on distribution and then more money marketing. This gave you a shot at sharing your music and allow your fans to financially support you. Hoping that there was a way to pay back the people who fronted the costs and then get some money to you as well.</p>

<p>So, with me making the beats and you laying down words, we’re in this together. So the blog is an opportunity for me to go over a number of funadmentals to help you get the most out of the beats you buy from me and hopefully build out your career.</p>
