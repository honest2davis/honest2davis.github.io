<p>You start as a fan of the craft with access to a whole bunch of incredible rappers slaying the mic both past and present. Vivid imagery of MJ on the stage when Drakeâ€™s referring to the black leather glove no sequins. The repetitive I GOT I GOT I GOT before the beat drops to Kendrick Lamarâ€™s track loyalty. Even that little adlib at the beginning of The Box by Roddy Rich just sits in the track so nicely.</p>
