<p>I’ve been building my experience in the music industry for a number of years and I help artists and creators by selling them <a href="https://soundee.com/honest2davis">instrumentals</a>. How is this possible? Because the market is getting bigger. In 2015, the IFPI measured the music market to have received $15 billion USD in revenue. Fast forward to 2019 and it’s valued at $19 billion USD <strong><a href="https://www.ifpi.org/media/downloads/GMR2019-en.pdf">source</a></strong>. This growth makes it <em>feel</em> like it’s a saturated market but in actual fact, it’s just that artists can reach audiences a lot easier.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p><strong>When it comes to a saturated market, think of your music as a coffee shop. It’s a saturated market for sure but the different experiences, processes and accessibility of your <em>coffee shop</em> gives you as an artist a chance to reach an audience.</strong></p>

<h2 id="no-one-will-buy-your-music">No one will buy your music</h2>

<p>This is technically <em>correct</em> because physical sales of music has been on the decline since 2005. We have technology to make it easier to listen to music. Technology has allowed music to become available anywhere at any time on any device. THe most important to note as it validates that the industry is still going.</p>

<p>If billion dollar companies like Apple, Google and Amazon have their own streaming platforms - it validates that they see a financial opportunity through this model as opposed to actual sales.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p>**Whilst there’s an increasingly low chance of people buying your music, there’s a higher chance of people buying your *“experience”.</p>
</blockquote>

<p>This changes the approach with how we can monetise our music journeys. The old way was to buy some studio time, record and then spend money on distribution and then more money marketing. This gave you a shot at sharing your music and allow your fans to financially support you. Hoping that there was a way to pay back the people who fronted the costs and then get some money to you as well.</p>

<h2 id="its-expensive-to-get-started">It’s expensive to get started</h2>

<p>The new way allows you to make beats on a busted laptop, record at home and upload it to a streaming platform for anyone to listen to. Put in some instagram work to get people to check you out and you’re on your way to making this a bit more viable then you initially thought it could be.</p>

<p>So, with me making the beats and you laying down words, we’re in this together. So the blog is an opportunity for me to go over a number of funadmentals to help you get the most out of the beats you buy from me and hopefully build out your career.</p>
