<p>Hi my name is Davis. I’m a music producer based out of Australia but born and raised in Wellington, New Zealand. Growing up I had two main passions, music and rugby. I’ve been pretty lucky to have achieved a few things in my rugby career which includes a bunch of championships and a stint in the middle east. That gave me an opportunity to understand the game at an intimate level and see places in the world I never thought I would.</p>

<p>However music has always been a passion of mine because it’s the chance to create an emotion through a bunch of noises and meaning behind words. I’ve been producing since I was 12 using a cracked version of Fruity Loops 4 and really caught the buzz.</p>

<p>A couple of things have changed since then with my music process and buying legit software. I’ve managed to get a few placements and have some of my work on TV so I feel like I’m moving in the right direction. I’ve always been a type to produce beats with artist and not until recently I’ve come across the beat leasing game and reaching a wider audience via the internet.</p>

<p>I love producing hip hop and R’n’B being a massive fan of those two genres. I also produce a little bit of UK Garage and Drill as it’s a maturing scene here in Australia/New Zealand.</p>

<p>My socials are below and my blog has a bunch of info that I think might be helpful. Hit me up if you have any questions.</p>
