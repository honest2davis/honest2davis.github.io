<p>Before you even consider buying beats, youâ€™ve got to know where you can find free beats to download. There are many sites and beat makers (myself included) who are helping artist by creating free beats to download.</p>

<p>Itâ€™s a little difficult when you search for beats online and you end up looking at the different Beats By Dre headphones when youâ€™re looking for hip hop and rap instrumentals.</p>

<p>Iâ€™ve put together six places you can find free beats to download and also some notes to take into consideration when you find ways to download beats from the internet.</p>

<h3 id="youtube"><a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a></h3>

<p>When it comes to finding free beats, YouTube should be your first stop for two reasons. Itâ€™s accessible on mobile, web or app and secondly, the search engine can help give you a continuous stream of beats. Why? This is because YouTube has 2 billion logged in users per month, so they work hard to ensure theyâ€™re serving you with relevant results.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get started is to search term search a â€™type beatâ€™ of your favourite artist. For example â€˜drake type beat 2020â€™ and the top beats are relevant ones others have used so itâ€™s a relatively tried and true method to find beats that you might like.</p>

<p>Protip: add an â€˜xâ€™ after the artists names to find combinations of type beats people are looking for. Eg, â€˜drake xâ€™ bring up a â€˜drake x Bryson tiller type beatâ€™ which might of interest to you.</p>
