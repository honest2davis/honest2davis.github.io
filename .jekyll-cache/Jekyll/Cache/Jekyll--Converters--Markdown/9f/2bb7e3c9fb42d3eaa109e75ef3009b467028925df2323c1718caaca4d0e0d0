<p>Before you even consider buying beats, you’ve got to know where you can find free beats to download. There are many sites and beat makers (myself included) who are helping artist by creating free beats to download.</p>

<p>It’s a little difficult when you search for beats online and you end up looking at the different Beats By Dre headphones when you’re looking for hip hop and rap instrumentals.</p>

<p>I’ve put together six places you can find free beats to download and also some notes to take into consideration when you find ways to download beats from the internet.</p>

<h3 id="youtube"><a href="http://youtube.com/">YouTube</a></h3>

<p>When it comes to finding free beats, YouTube should be your first stop for two reasons. It’s accessible on mobile, web or app and secondly, the search engine can help give you a continuous stream of beats. Why? This is because YouTube has 2 billion logged in users per month, so they work hard to ensure they’re serving you with relevant results.</p>

<p>The easiest way to get started is to search term search a ’type beat’ of your favourite artist. For example ‘drake type beat 2020’ and the top beats are relevant ones others have used so it’s a relatively tried and true method to find beats that you might like.</p>

<p>Protip: add an ‘x’ after the artists names to find combinations of type beats people are looking for. Eg, ‘drake x’ bring up a ‘drake x Bryson tiller type beat’ which might of interest to you.</p>
