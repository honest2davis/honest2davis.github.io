<p>A number of my customers recommended I take time to address some common concerns artists have with leasing and buying beats so I‚Äôve come up with some answers to common questions people ask me when they‚Äôre in the process of buying my beats.  Music is a dark business at times and it‚Äôs all about working together to create something special. We are both investing time and money into the craft. I‚Äôve answered a number of questions below but if there‚Äôs anything I can help with, don‚Äôt hesitate to get in touch via my social media accounts or by email: beats@honest2davis.com!</p>

<h3 id="is-your-website-safe-to-buy-beats-from">Is your website safe to buy beats from?</h3>
<p>Absolutely! I accept all major Credit Cards and Paypal as well. Using Stripe and Paypal to accept payments adds an extra level of security. If you‚Äôre really having second thoughts after you‚Äôve purchased a beat, <strong>get in touch within 30 days</strong> for a refund, no questions asked!</p>

<h3 id="do-you-have-any-deals-or-anything">Do you have any deals or anything?</h3>
<p>Definitely, COVID is playing games with everyone so, I‚Äôm currently running a buy 1, get 1 beat free. If that‚Äôs still not enough (and you‚Äôve taken time to read the FAQ), use <strong>honest2davis</strong> at the checkout to get a further 15% off this bulk deal.</p>

<h3 id="but-for-real-do-you-have-any-other-deals">But for real do you have any other deals?</h3>
<p>Look I can hook you up with a five pack of beats if you really need it - simply visit <a href="http://free.honest2davis.com/">free.honest2davis.com</a> and I‚Äôll get you a link to a folder with some. If the discount code and the free beats can‚Äôt quite help, feel free to get in touch via the form below.</p>

<h3 id="when-do-i-receive-my-beats">When do I receive my beat(s)?</h3>
<p>They‚Äôre available immediately for download once you‚Äôve completed your payment. You will also receive an email with your receipt and links again.</p>

<h3 id="how-can-i-access-the-beats-ive-purchased">How can I access the beat(s) I‚Äôve purchased?</h3>
<p>Download links are given and you have instant access. If you have an iPhone, you can save the beat into your files app and then access if there. Android also lets you save and play MP3 and WAV files directly from your phone too.</p>

<h3 id="are-your-tags-on-the-beats-that-i-buy">Are your tags on the beat(s) that I buy?</h3>
<p>No, I take them off most beats ( I wanna let people focus on your art not the annoying tag at the beginning!). If you want it on there - get in touch and I‚Äôll sort it out.</p>

<h3 id="what-are-stems-and-do-i-get-them">What are STEMS and do I get them?</h3>
<p>Stems are stereo recordings sourced from mixes of multiple individual tracks which you are welcome to purchase on the site. I recommend buying stems so that if you plan on recording your song in a professional studio, you can have more control of the mix.</p>

<h3 id="you-mentioned-that-you-are-leasing-the-beat-to-me-what-does-that-mean">You mentioned that you are leasing the beat to me. What does that mean?</h3>

<p>When you purchase a beat through the <a href="/beat-store">Beat Store</a>, you are buying the rights to use the beat in a limited and non-exclusive way. honest2davis retains full copyright and ownership over this (also known as a composition). The only exception to this is if someone purchases the exclusive rights to the beat. In that case, I‚Äôll remove it from the beat store.</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-if-i-exceed-my-stream-limit-or-sales-limit">What happens if I exceed my stream limit or sales limit?</h3>
<p>If this happens, get in touch so we can celebrate! We‚Äôll also need to upgrade your license which we can do together, just get in touch.</p>

<h3 id="when-i-buy-a-beat-do-you-remove-it-from-the-store">When I buy a beat, do you remove it from the store?</h3>
<p>Only if it‚Äôs an exclusive!</p>

<h3 id="what-happens-if-i-lease-a-beat-but-later-on-someone-else-buys-it-as-an-exclusive">What happens if I lease a beat, but later on, someone else buys it as an exclusive?</h3>
<p>It doesn‚Äôt affect the people who have the beat lease before it was purchased as an exclusive.</p>

<h3 id="unlimited-license-is-there-any-difference-to-an-exclusive">Unlimited license? Is there any difference to an exclusive?</h3>
<p>Similar to the above, Usage rights are the same, but the person who purchased the exclusive will mean that it‚Äôll be no longer for sale in the future.</p>

<h3 id="so-how-much-are-exclusive">So how much are exclusive?!</h3>
<p>It all depends tbh! From my side, you limit my opportunity to make money from the craft but I understand that you wouldn‚Äôt want others with the beat, email me on beats@honest2davis.com so we can work something out.</p>

<h3 id="i-want-to-lease-a-beat-so-what-can-i-use-it-for">I want to lease a beat, so what can I use it for?!</h3>
<p>You bought it so use it however you need in your creative journey. Songs, podcasts intro, youtube vids, ads - anything you need to use it for. Get in touch if you have any other questions.</p>
