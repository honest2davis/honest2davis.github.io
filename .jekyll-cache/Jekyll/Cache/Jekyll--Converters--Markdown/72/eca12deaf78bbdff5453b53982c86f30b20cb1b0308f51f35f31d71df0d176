<p>Thanks for checking out the beat store. So I can help you, I’m doing a <strong>Buy 1 Get 1 Free</strong> promotion, the discount will be applied at the checkout! The discount will be applied when you add the beats into the shopping cart. There’s a wide range of hip hop and r’n’b beats to chose from and I’ve helped hundreds of artists so I’m hoping that I can help you out as well. If you have questions around the way things work and our money back guarantee, visit our <a href="/faq"><strong>FAQ section</strong></a></p>

<h3 id="beat-licensing-info-below">Beat licensing info below</h3>
<p>Below are some of the limits so you get an idea of what you’re paying for. If you’re starting out - I suggest the MP3, if you need the stems, grab the trackout license. You can always upgrade into different licenses too. If you need any clarification - visit the <a href="/faq"><strong>FAQ section</strong></a></p>
