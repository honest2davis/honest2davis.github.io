<p>I’ve been building my experience in the music industry for a number of years and I help artists and creators by selling them my instrumentals. Why? Because the market is getting bigger. In 2015, the IFPI measured the music market to have received $15 billion USD in revenue. Fast forward to 2019 and it’s valued at $19 billion USD <strong><a href="https://www.ifpi.org/media/downloads/GMR2019-en.pdf">source</a></strong>. This growth makes it <em>feel</em> like it’s a saturated market but in actual fact, it’s just that we can reach artists a lot easier. Which leads to the second common excuse that you’ll hear.</p>

<p>This changes the approach with how we can monetise our music journeys. The old way was to buy some studio time, record and then spend money on distribution and then more money marketing.

Hoping that there was a way to pay back the people who fronted the costs and then get some money to you as well.</p>

<p>The new way allows you to make beats on a busted laptop, record at home and upload it to a streaming platform for anyone to listen to. Put in some instagram work to get people to check you out and you’re on your way to making this a bit more viable then you initially thought it could be.</p>

<p>So, with me making the beats and you laying down words, we’re in this together. So the blog is an opportunity for me to go over a number of funadmentals to help you get the most out of the beats you buy from me and hopefully build out your career.</p>
