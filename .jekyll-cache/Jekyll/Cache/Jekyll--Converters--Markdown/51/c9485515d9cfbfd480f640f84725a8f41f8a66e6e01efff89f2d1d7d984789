<p>Buying beats is an awesome way to build your sound and sharpening you skillsl. Before looking any further - I wanted to share three tips before you look to buy beats.</p>

<p><img src="/images/pic01.jpg" alt="image info" /> what is happening</p>
<h2 id="1-dont-be-afraid-to-ask">1. Don’t be afraid to ask!</h2>

<p>If you’re not ready to by something right now, sign up below so I can give you free beat! Hope that can help the journey. Also feel free to get in contact to make an offer on any beat you have your eye on. Happy to help you where I can. Keep reading for a code.</p>

<h2 id="2-buy-what-you-can-afford">2. Buy what you can afford</h2>

<p>We’re in a pandemic which is creating uncertain times. Prioritise your health before buying beats. I’ve included bulk deals to help make it easier on the wallet and I’ll also include the discount code: covid19 for 15% all beats in store.</p>

<p>Img: use COVID19 to get 8% off everything in store.</p>

<h2 id="3-mp3s-for-beginners-and-wavs-for-advanced">3. MP3’s for beginners and WAV’s for advanced.</h2>

<p>All of my beats follow a typical song structure of a three verses and three hook sections. If you’re just starting out - I recommend getting the MP3 and letting the track guide you. If you want more control of the end product, advances artists should look to get the WAV files which also include all the track outs.</p>
