## 1. MP3’s for beginners and WAV’s for advanced. 

All of my beats follow a typical song structure of three verses and three hook sections. If you’re just starting out - I recommend getting the MP3 and letting the track guide you. If you want more control of the end product, advanced artists should look to get the WAV files which also include all the track outs. If it helps, you can **buy 1 and get 2 free**. <br>

### Check out the beat store below:

## 2. Buy what you can afford

We’re in a pandemic which is creating uncertain times. Prioritise your health before buying beats. I’ve included bulk deals to help make it easier on the wallet. If you're feeling a beat and it's out of the price range, free to get in contact to make an offer on any beat you have your eye on.

## 3. Don’t be afraid to ask!

If you’re not ready to buy something right now, **pop your email down below** so I can give you a five pack of royalty free beats! Hope that can help the journey. Happy to help you where I can.
