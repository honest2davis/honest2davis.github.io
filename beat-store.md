## Beat store

Thanks for checking out the beat store. So I can help you, I'm doing a **Buy 1 Get 1 Free** promotion, the discount will be applied at the checkout! There's a wide range of hip hop and r'n'b beats to chose from and I've helped hundreds of artists so I'm hoping that I can help you out as well. If you have questions around the way things work and our money back guarantee, visit our [**FAQ section**](/faq)

### My personal guarantee: 30 day no questions asked refund policy.
Whilst it's strictly a no refund business, I understand that there can be changing circumstances. Get in touch with me if there's been a change of heart and you need a refund. I'll be happy to refund you, no questions asked!

### Beat licensing info below
Below are some of the limits so you get an idea of what you're paying for. If you're starting out - I suggest the MP3, if you need the stems, grab the trackout license. You can always upgrade into different licenses too. If you need any clarification - visit the [**FAQ section**](/faq)
