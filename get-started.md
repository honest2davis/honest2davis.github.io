## 1. MP3’s for beginners and WAV’s for advanced. 

All of my beats follow a typical song structure of three verses and three hook sections. If you’re just starting out - I recommend getting the MP3 and letting the track guide you. If you want more control of the end product, advanced artists should look to get the WAV files which also include all the track outs. If it helps, you can **buy 1 and get 2 free**. Check out the beat store below:

## 2. Buy what you can afford

We’re in a pandemic which is creating uncertain times. Prioritise your health before buying beats. I’ve included bulk deals to help make it easier on the wallet.

## 3. Don’t be afraid to ask!
